# TODO List for Portfolio Site Development

- [x] Update index.html: Add Bootstrap CDN links, Google Fonts import (Roboto Thin), and structure the page with sections (Hero/About Me, Experience, Projects, Contact, Social Networks) using Bootstrap classes for responsiveness.
- [x] Update style.css: Add custom styles for white/blue/black color scheme, thin font, minimalist design, and ensure responsiveness.
- [x] Update script.js: Add minimal JavaScript for smooth scrolling to sections and any basic interactivity.
- [x] Test the site by opening index.html in a browser to verify layout and responsiveness.
- [x] Change font to a different Google Font (e.g., Lato).
- [x] Add dark/light mode toggle functionality.
- [x] Test the updated site with new font and dark mode.
